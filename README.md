# 🤖 Corporate-Bot — Enterprise RAG Assistant

**Corporate-Bot** is a production-grade, agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that enables users to upload corporate PDFs and interact with them using natural language.

It provides **accurate, grounded answers and structured workplace actions** powered by HuggingFace-hosted LLM inference.

# 🌐 Live Architecture

Frontend: Next.js (Vercel)
Backend: Flask API (HuggingFace Spaces — Docker)
LLM: HuggingFace Inference API (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct:novita)

# 🚀 Core Capabilities

## 📄 Document Intelligence (RAG)

Upload any corporate PDF and:

* Ask factual questions
* Get grounded answers
* Receive structured responses
* Prevent hallucinations

Supports:

* Text
* Tables
* Structured content

---

## ⚙️ Agent-Based Reasoning

The system intelligently detects user intent:

Example:

**User Input**

> Create a ticket for VPN not working

**Output**

```json
{
  "action": "create_ticket",
  "department": "IT",
  "priority": "High",
  "description": "VPN not working"
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Hallucination Control

Strict refusal logic:

If answer not present:

> Information not found in uploaded document.

No guessing. No fabricated answers.
